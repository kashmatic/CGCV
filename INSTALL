- Opera


Prerequisites
-----------

CPAN Perl Modules
---------------------

The following Perl modules are required by CGCV. They can be downloaded from the CPAN archive at http://www.cpan.org.

- DBI ( >= 1.607 )
- DBD::mysql ( >= 4.008 )
- HTML::Template ( >= 2.9 )
- GD ( >= 2.41 )
- Math::Round ( >= 0.05 )
- Proc::Simple ( >= 1.23 )
- Apache::Session::File ( >= 1.81 )

Core Perl Modules
---------------------

The following Perl modules are required by CGCV, but are part of a default Perl installation. If they are not available on your system, you can download them from CPAN.

- CGI ( CGI.pm >= 3.40 )
- CGI::Carp ( CGI.pm >= 3.40 )
- Data::Dumper ( >= 2.121 )
- Digest::MD5 ( >= 2.36 )
- Math::Round ( >= 0.06 )
- File::stat ( >= 0.01 )
- POSIX ( perl 5.10 )


Installation of Perl Modules
--------------------------------

Perl modules can be installed automatically using the cpan utility that is installed as part of Perl. Instructions for using cpan are available at

 http://perldoc.perl.org/CPAN.html

If you require more control over the installation, or have trouble with the cpan utility, instructions for installing modules by hand is available at

 http://perldoc.perl.org/perlmodinstall.html


Database Setup
-----------------

CGCV requires a MySQL database to store data and generate results. By default, CGCV will connect to MySQL installed on the local machine, using the username cgcv
and the database name cgcv_database. To setup CGCV with these default settings, issue the following commands from the unix command prompt.

To create the username bov, without password
 # mysql -u root -p password -e 'create user cgcv@localhost'
With password
 # mysql -u root -p password -e 'create user cgcv@localhost identified by password'

To create the database and give permissions to your user
 # mysql -u root -p password -e 'create database cgcv_database'
 # mysql -u root -p password -e 'grant select,insert,create,drop on cgcv_database.* to cgcv@localhost'

If you want to use different database settings, reference the MySQL documentation for instructions on how to configure the database.


Upload Directory
------------------

The Upload direcory is the folder on your filesystem into which the files uploaded to the CGCV program are saved and processed. In the setup.sh file, you are required 
to provide the path to the folder where you would like the data to be uploaded to (by changing the Upload_dir variable). Since Apache requires to access this data, 
you are required to change the permissions (chmod) of the folder to 700 and change the ownership (chown) of the directory to the user and group that runs Apache.


Installation
------------

1. Download CGCV from http://cgb.indiana.edu/files/downloads/CGCV.tar.gz

2. Uncompress CGCV using the command

 # tar -zxvf CGCV.tar.gz

3. Edit the setup.sh to customize CGCV for your location. You must set the parameters under "REQUIRED PARAMETERS". If you did not use the default database settings,
   you must also define the connection information under "OPTIONAL PARAMETERS". 

4. Edit the upload_directory variable to store all the files generated by this program. You can change ownership of the directory to the account and group that 
   Apache runs as and set the permissions to 700.

5. Execute the setup command

 # sh setup.sh

   to configure CGCV, this creates three folders in the same directory called 'cgi-bin', 'htdocs' and 'bin'.

6. If you have set the 'lifetime' value in setup.sh for automatic expiration of results, a perl script will be created in

   bin/cleanDir.pl

   To have this command executed automatically, you need to add the following entry to your crontab.

* 0 * * * perl /PATH/TO/cleanDir.pl

7. Rename the 'htdocs' directory to 'CGCV' and copy it to the directory that your Apache installation uses for HTML files. This directory is defined in your Apache 
   configuration file (/path/to/apache/conf/httpd.conf) as 'DocumentRoot'. So if your Apache configuration shows the following DocumentRoot:

	DocumentRoot "/var/www/htdocs"

   you would execute

 # cp -rp htdocs /var/www/htdocs/CGCV

8. Rename the cgi-bin directory to CGCV and copy it to the directory your apache installation uses for cgi-bin executables. This may be defined as 'ScriptAlias' 
   in your apache configuration.

        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin"

   in which case you would execute

 # cp -rp cgi-bin /var/www/cgi-bin/CGCV

   If your apache configuration does not include ScriptAlias, then append cgi-bin to the DocumentRoot, e.g.
 # cp -rp cgi-bin /var/www/htdocs/cgi-bin/CGCV

9. Change to the bin directory and execute the following commands to download the files and set up the MySQL database with the necessary tables for the viewer.
For Bacterial genomes, run:
        sh create-Prokaryotes.sh

   For Eukaryotic genomes,
        sh create-Eukaryotes.sh

NOTE: Both these scripts take a considerable amount of time to download and set up the service on your local system. To test our service, you may choose to run the following script:
        sh sampler.sh

This will download a sample set of sequences corresponding to Bacteria(5 organisms) and Eukaryotes(2 organisms) and sets up the necessary MySQL tables.


Data Directory
-----------------

The Data directory is the folder on your filesystem into which the files from the FTP servers will be downloaded and kept upto date. In the setup.sh file, you are required to provide the path to the folder where you would like the data to be downloaded and stored (by changing the Genomes_path variable).

As an example, if you choose to place your data in the following folder (either for Prokaryotes or Eukaryotes):

  /home/username/CGCV/Data/[Bacteria | Eukaryotes]/

the installation script will create the following folder and the script that downloads the data will create the following data structure inside that folder:

  /home/username/CGCV/Data/[Bacteria     | Eukaryotes]/subfolder
  
  List of subfolders:
  ..                        genomes        genomes
  ..                        aaseqs         aaseqs
  ..                        geneseqs
  ..                        gff_files      gtf_files
  ..                        listings       listings
  ..                        tmpListings    tmpListings
  ..                        tables         tables

Free space required (minimum):
  
  Script                    Free space
  ------------------------------------
  create-Prokaryotes.sh     ~ 8-9 GB
  create-Eukaryotes.sh      ~ 6-7 GB

Please make sure that you run the create-Prokaryotes.sh and the create-Eukaryotes.sh scripts only once (otherwise, the downloaded data will get corrupted)
